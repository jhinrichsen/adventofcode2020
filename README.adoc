= Advent Of Code (AOC) 2020

My take on the AOC, documenting my errors.
This document does not include solutions.

== Development setup
- Go 1.15.5
- vim, vim-go, gopls
- VisualStudio Code for debugging

The package name is aoc2020.
Each day is separate in a `day{{.n}}.go` and `day{{.n}}_test.go` file.
Unit test data, both examples and puzzle input, is in `testdata/day{{.n}}.txt`.

== Day 1 
Warmup, nice and smooth.

== Day 2 
Warmup, nice and smooth.

== Day 3
The example's unit test succeeded, but part 1 failed, 284 being too low.
