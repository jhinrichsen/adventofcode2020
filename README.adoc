My take on https://adventofcode.com/2020/ in Go.
Usually, i don't go for implementation speed, because that does not resonate well with me.
My second highest priority is runtime performance, and priority number one is getting it right the first time.
Therefore, i always provide complete coverage via unit tests.
Go just makes this _so_ easy.

This document does not include solutions so no worries to read it at any point in time.
Solutions are hardcoded into unit tests, so you won't see any solutions as long as you avoid looking at `*_test.go` files.

== Environment

- Go 1.15..1.24
- vim, vim-go, gopls, fed by an HHKB
- VisualStudio Code for complex debugging scenarios
- Fedora 33..42
- AMD Ryzen 5 3400G on a Gigabyte B450

Each day lives separately in a `day{{.n}}.go` and `day{{.n}}_test.go` file.
Unit test data, both examples and puzzle input, is in `testdata/day{{.n}}.txt`, and `testdata/day{{.n}}_example.txt`.

== Day 1: Report Repair

Warmup, nice and smooth.

Blattschuss, Blattschuss (answer correct on first try).

----

The size of the allocation doubles using a conservative map size, but the number of allocations drop 4x.
Concurrent uses an async chan between parser and solver, but as usual, the channel introduces more overhead than it shaves off the runtime.

== Day 2: Password Philosophy

Warmup, nice and smooth.

Blattschuss, Blattschuss.

== Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory

The example's unit test succeeded, but part 1 failed, 284 being too low.
I refrained from implementing a too-complex implementation based on complex numbers (x/y), and operated directly on the indexable lines[][] area.

Fail, Blattschuss.

== Day 4: Passport Processing

First try 234 again too low.
Needed an extra blank line at the end of the file to make sure last pass was validated.

For part 2, unit testing found an error before submitting the correct result.

Fail, Blattschuss.

`Hair color` is defined as `a # followed by exactly six characters 0-9 or a-f`.
So check for a leading '#', and then iterate the remaining slice:

====
----
if s[0] != '#' {
    return false
}
for i := range s[1:] {
    if '0' <= s[i] && s[i] <= '9' { // WRONG
        ...
    }
}
----
====

`s[1:]` is the correct slice, `i` is `0` for the first iteration, indexing `s[i]` does _not_ index the slice but the original string, so it will point to `#`.
====
----
num := s[1:]
for i := range num {
    if '0' <= num[i] && num[i] <= '9' { // CORRECT
        ...
    }
}
----
====

== Day 5: Binary Boarding

Blattschuss, Blattschuss.

== Day 6: Custom Customs

Blattschuss, Blattschuss.

== Day 7: Handy Haversacks

Blattschuss, Blattschuss.

Coming back to part #2, reusing the shunting yard algorithm from day 18.

== Day 8: Handheld Halting

Blattschuss.

Part 2 ran like a champ, but the answer was not accepted, too low. After re-reading the instructions, the program must terminate at the last line, not somewhere.

== Day 9: Encoding Error

Blattschuss, Blattschuss.

== Day 10: Adapter Array

Blattschuss, Blattschuss.

I feel proud because i figured out the O(n) solution all by myself.

== Day 11: Seating System

Blattschuss, Blattschuss.

=== iter.Seq Optimization (2024)

Refactored to use flat array storage and `C8Indices` iterator from `grid.go` for Part 1.
The iterator provides pre-computed 8-connectivity neighbor indices without bounds checking.

|===
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement

| Time (Part 1) | 10.1 ms | 3.9 ms | 2.6x faster
| Memory | 1.47 MB | 37 KB | 40x less
| Allocations | 12,301 | 110 | 112x fewer
|===

Part 2 uses ray-casting (visibility) which doesn't fit the iter.Seq pattern, but still benefits from flat array storage.

== Day 12: Rain Risk

Bad first guess for part #1. Upon debugging, i realized `turn` commands come with a number, so instead of `T` turning right, one needs to consider `T90`, `T180` and the like.
The example contained a 'R90', but not multiple turns, so this one went unnoticed.
Second try was correct.

Implementation is based on complex numbers (again), and Go's native support shows in 0 allocations:

== Day 14: Docking Data

Blattschuss.

== Day 15: Rambunctious Recitation

Blattschuss. Blattschuss.

Started implementation using arrays and indices, but soon ran out of control with zero-based versus one-based and my beloved off-by-one. Restarted using a map, runs like a charm.

No changes for part 2, benchmarks look ok:

That's about 6 to 7 seconds per sample.
I expect interesting solutions from the guys that really squeeze for performance.
Will be hard to come up with a O(1), i guess.

== Day 16: Ticket Translation

Blattschuss, Blattschuss.

== Day 17: Conway Cubes

Blattschuss.

Nearly-bug #1: when figuring out the neighbours in 3D space, the number of neighbours is fixed 26.
I created an array with appropriate capacity:

====
----
cubes := make([]cube, 3*3*3-1)
----
====

and then happily `append`ed
====
----
cubes = append(cubes, neighbour)
----
====

instead of writing directly to the array (`cubes[idx] = ...` ), creating 52 neighbours.
Not sure how to categorize this kind of error - muscle memory?

Nearly-bug #2: i started in optimized mode, in this puzzle z population grows symmetrically in -z and +z. Considering only z >= 0, and mirroring -z somehow into +z got me to 58 instead of 112 active cubes in the example. As soon as i dropped this idea, it worked.

And yes, code became cleaner, and runtime performance, well...

====

That's about 100 ms.
Fast enough for all practical purposes.

Blattschuss, Blattschuss.

Shunting Yard to the rescue, see doc/MR35.PDF.
Dijkstra, _1961_.

Part 2 needed just a slight reconfiguration of operator precedence, lucky me.

== Day 19: Monster Messages

Blattschuss.

== Day 20: Jurassic Jigsaw

Blattschuss.

This one needed a bit of trial and error.
I keep vim open in an editing session terminal, and run continuous `go test -run=Day20 -timeout=10s` in a second window.

The implemenation is pretty clumsy, but hey.

3 ms, including loading puzzle input, finding corners, and validating expected result.

== Day 21: Allergen Assessment

Blattschuss. Blattschuss.

It took me an hour to understand the problem, and i had to look for help in reddit. Still did not understand anything, that's when i took a piece of paper and a pen to get going.

Clearly, the memoization pattern `fmt.Sprintf("%v", deck)` needs some love.
Switching card type from `uint` to `byte`, and using an MD5 checksum:

Runtime drops to 65%, i.e. the change shaved off 1/3 for part #1, which is more than i expected because part #1 does not use memoization at all.

For part #2, runtime drops to 15%, i.e. 7 times faster.
In absolute values, from 1.6s to 260ms.


== Day 23: Crab Cups

Blattschuss.

What a lovely number cruncher.
It's puzzles like this i enjoy the most.
Of course i got completely lost in index layers, off-by-one and the like, until i hit DEL and restarted from scratch.

Criticism of Go mostly circles around missing generics, and that it is a garbage collected language.
Unless you produce garbage, there's nothing to collect:

The first example (10 moves) executes in 582 _nanoseconds_, that's 0.6μs, or 0.0006 milliseconds.
Not optimized yet.

Part #2 obviously picks a number range that is too high to compute (1 million cups, 10 million moves).
With runtime performance like this (10 million moves for 10 cups in 0.5s), i'm tempted to number crunch part #2.
The algorithm should be O(n), so 50.000s which is equal to half a day.
Longer than Eric's usual runtime promise, but hey.

== Day 24: Lobby Layout

Blattschuss. Blattschuss.

Again one of those absolutely adorable puzzles.
Once i figured out on a piece of paper how to transform a hexagonal floor into something i can move on, it went smooth.

Except for one nasty bug in part 2, when checking for active neighbours i traversed the list `for _, c := range []HexFloor{1 + 0i, 0 + 1i, 0 - 1i, -1 + 1i, 1 + 1i, -1 + 0i} {`, but should instead have traversed `for _, c := range []HexFloor{1 + 0i, 0 + 1i, 0 - 1i, -1 + 1i, 1 - 1i, -1 + 0i} {`.

Hard to spot.

=== iter.Seq Optimization (2024)

Refactored Part 2 to use dense array storage and `C6Indices` iterator from `grid.go`.
The iterator provides pre-computed 6-connectivity (hexagonal) neighbor indices.

|===
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement

| Time (Part 2) | 262 ms | 14.5 ms | 18x faster
| Memory | 14.5 MB | 489 KB | 30x less
| Allocations | 4,701 | 2,239 | 2x fewer
|===

The original sparse `map[complex128]` approach required iterating over a bounding box and checking map membership for each neighbor. The dense array with pre-computed indices eliminates this overhead.

== Day 25: Combo Breaker

Blattschuss.

Using the smaller of the two loop sizes to calculate the encryption key.
Other than that, nothing special.

== SAST (Static Application Security Testing)

This project uses custom SAST tooling in GitLab CI, optimized for the free tier.

=== GitLab Free Tier Limitations

GitLab's built-in SAST features (Security Dashboard, vulnerability management, merge request security widgets) require the Ultimate tier. On the free tier, SAST scans can run but results are only available as downloadable JSON artifacts.

=== Current Setup

Our CI pipeline uses:

- Code Quality Reports: golangci-lint → JSON → banyansecurity/golint-convert → CodeClimate JSON format
  * Displays findings in merge request Code Quality widget (available in free tier since GitLab 13.2)
  * Shows code quality degradations/improvements directly in MRs

- Test Reports: go-junit-report/v2 → JUnit XML format
  * Integrates test results into GitLab's test report UI

- Coverage Reports: gocover-cobertura → Cobertura XML format
  * Shows coverage metrics and trends in merge requests

- Vulnerability Scanning: govulncheck (periodic, scheduled pipeline)
  * Scans for known vulnerabilities in Go dependencies
  * Runs on a schedule to catch newly disclosed vulnerabilities
  * Results available as JSON artifacts (no UI on free tier)

=== Note on Deprecation

GitLab deprecated its built-in CodeClimate scanning template in version 17.3 (planned removal in 19.0). This only affects GitLab's bundled scanning engine. Custom pipelines that generate CodeClimate-format JSON (like ours) continue to work and are the recommended approach for free tier users.

The Code Quality widget will continue to display results from custom CodeClimate JSON reports.
